# logdet
Riemannian trust-region method for the log-determinant model of Hermitian matrix eigenproblems

## Problems
### This solver is to solve the following optimization problem
			{\rm minimize}\qquad  -{\rm log~det}\left(I_p+U^HAUN\right),\\
			{\rm subject\; to}\quad~~ U \in \St\left(p, n, \C \right),\nonumber
  
where \widetilde{U} is a 2n-by-2p matrix, Jn = [0 In; In 0], and I2p is the 2p-by-2p identity matrix.
